# EnsembleLearning-DetectCreditCardFraud
This project aims to detect credit card fraud using Binary classification algorithms for a highly imbalanced dataset.
The project report explains all the pre-processing steps and how the data imbalance issue is addressed.
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated through various metrics to achieve an accuracy of 100%.
